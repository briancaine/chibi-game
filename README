I'm going to put useful gamedev code here, starting with bindings for SDL.

My bindings are probably going to be pretty incomplete for awhile. I'm just writing what's useful to me at the moment.

With all of this stuff, your mileage may vary.

Everything, including building, is dependent on bcaine/chibi-obj.

Pull requests welcome.
